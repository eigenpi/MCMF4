SUMMARY
=======

MCMF4: Minimum-cost maximum-flow 

This is an adapted version of the Edmonds-Karp relabelling mcmf 
algorithm [1], originally implemented by Igor Naverniouk. This 
adapted version allocates memory dynamically in order to use 
memory as needed.

    Efficieincy for Network Flow Problems," J. ACM, vol. 19, pp. 248-264, 1972.


CREDITS
=======

This is an adapted (i.e., ported to C++) version of the Edmonds-Karp 
algo from: http://shygypsy.com/tools/mcmf4.cpp
The original authors of that implementation: Frank Chu and Igor Naverniouk.
It is called "4" because perhaps it was their version four of their code.
